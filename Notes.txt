(p - proven, d - additionally done, td - todo, r - needs a research, s - encountered problem solved)
1. td - Add checking if injected views meet the contract (IHeadered etc).
2. td - Add region adapter behavior that disposes view and view model instances upon removing.
3. s - Plugins should live in a separate solution due to how VS manages dll references in dependent projects.
4. td - Write RegionManager extension methods to attach pluggable views in a type-safe manner.
5. td - Write NugetModuleCatalog.
6. td - Solve scoped region managers problem for navigation. (Pluralsight)
7. r - Wpf application and Api server should share the same IoC container. Or at least, Api server's container should be populated with the Wpf's one.
8. r - Loggers registered in Wpf application should be accessible in the Api server.
9. td - Region names should be type-safe - e.g. static class with constants.
10. td - All api endpoints should be mapped on application initialization - that's why modules should ALWAYS be loaded on startup (startupLoaded option should be hidden from developer).
