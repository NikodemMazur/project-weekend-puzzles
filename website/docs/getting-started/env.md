# Preparing the environment

Make sure you have all components listed in this section installed. Please note, I am not sure if the following VS version should be strictly adhered to. This is simply what I had installed during the development. Probably older versions will be sufficient.

- Windows 10 Build 19622 or later (to support .NET Framework 4.6.1 along with `WinHttpHandler`)
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 (what the clients are built with)
- .NET 5.0 (for .NET 5 WPF)
- Git
- Visual Studio 2019 with following components:
    - .NET Desktop Development
    - .NET Core cross-platform development
