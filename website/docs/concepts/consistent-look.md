# Consistent look

Material Design in XAML is a set of thematic controls and icons that let a user create a beautiful modern flat UI in seconds. Theme can be changed dynamically which results in applying a current color palette to every control in both the shell and users' modules. User can introduce a color palette on his own or simply let the UI inherit it from the shell. However, to achieve a consistent look throughout the entire application, the latter is recommended.
